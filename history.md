## Version 2.3.4 / 2014-05-23

* Add `--debug` option to turn on debug output.

## Version 2.3.3 / 2014-05-22

* Use longer timeout.

## Version 2.3.1 / 2014-05-07

* The `.wti` configuration file is now parsed by ERB so the API token can be stored in an environment variable instead of in the `.wti` file. #118

## Version 2.3.0 / 2014-04-18

* Deprecate `wti push --all`.
  This command was replaced by `wti push --target`, which is slightly different since it only pushes target locales.
  The `--all` option was deprecated because pushing all source and target files at the same time can cause synchronization issues under some circumstances.
* Add new `wti push --target` command to push target files only.
* Read more about these changes the blog: https://webtranslateit.com/en/blog/posts/264-Updates-to-synching-behaviour

## Version 2.2.2 / 2014-03-13

* Bug fix on `wti pull`.

## Version 2.1.7 / 2013-08-28

* New: Ability to pull a specific file or directory.
  Examples: `wti pull path/to/file.json` to pull a file.
            `wti pull config/locales/javascript/*` to pull all the files in the `config/locales/javascript directory.
* Bug fixes to autofetch.

## Version 2.1.6 / 2013-08-02

* Commands now display more information, such as the current project’s name.

* New: add ability to initialize project with a one-liner: `wti init api_token`. #94
* Catch errors when running commands in a directory not containing a .wti file. #98

## Version 2.1.2 / 2013-04-20

* Update my name so it doesn’t contain accentuated characters anymore (seems to make jruby/rubygems 2.0.3 fail to install the gem). #96

## Version 2.1.1 / 2013-04-15

* Upgrade dependency on multipart-post, which includes a few compatibility fixes to ruby 2.0.

## Version 2.0.8 / 2013-04-04

* Update CA cert of the WebTranslateit’s issuer (Rapid SSL). #95.

## Version 2.0.7 / 2013-04-04

  so removed some code that was handling stale stats in `wti status`. #93

## Version 2.0.6 / 2013-03-11

* Remove dependency on JSON. We use `multi_json` instead so wti should now be easier to install.
  (it previously required a C compiler to install).

## Version 2.0.5 / 2013-02-22

* New: Add ability to pass a file path in `wti push`: `wti push path/to/file`. #90.
* Made it a bit clearer that wti push now takes an optional file path.

* String, Translation, Term and TermTranslation classes now raise exceptions and display useful error messages. #87
* Implemented pagination for `String#find_all` and `Term#find_all`. This should work seemlessly with no API change.

## Version 2.0.1 / 2012-05-11

* Fix: Issue with saving labels on a string.

## Version 2.0.0 / 2012-04-24

* Add more helpers to `wti init` a project
* Add ability to add a source locale to a project from the command line: the first `wti addlocale xx` sets the source locale.
* `wti add`: Display if there are no new files to add.

## Version 2.0.0.rc4 / 2012-04-23

* Allow instantiating `WebTranslateIt::String` and `WebTranslateIt::Term` using a Hash made of symbols or strings.

## Version 2.0.0.rc3 / 2012-04-19

* Remove deprecated `wti server`.
* Reword command help and output.

* Refactor `WebTranslateIt::String` and `WebTranslateIt::Translation` classes and add specs. #85
* Refactor `WebTranslateIt::Term` and `WebTranslateIt::TermTranslation` classes and add specs.

## Version 1.10.2 / 2012-04-17

* Compatibility fix for ruby 1.8.7.

## Version 1.10.1 / 2012-04-10

* New: Prevent existing master files from being added again on `wti add`.
  This allows to run something like: `ls *.xml | grep -v "\.en" | xargs wti add` without worrying about adding files a second time. Patch submitted by Ivan Kolesnikov <ik@playtox.ru>.
* New: Better error messages. #82.

## Version 1.9.5 / 2012-02-06

* Include classes to connect to [TermBase](http://docs.webtranslateit.com/api/term_base/) and [TermBase Translation](http://docs.webtranslateit.com/api/term_base_translation/) APIs.

## Version 1.9.4 / 2012-01-10

* Bug fix: Prevent `wti` from crashing when pulling from a project having no files.

## Version 1.9.3 / 2011-12-21

* Bug fix: the round(1) used in performance statistics wasn’t compatible with ruby < 1.9.

## Version 1.9.2 / 2011-12-21

* Gem now includes library to connect to [String](http://docs.webtranslateit.com/api/string/) and [Translation](http://docs.webtranslateit.com/api/translation/) APIs, see #74 and #78. (@bray).
* Add `<filename>` placeholder.
* Bug fix: don’t crash when running `wti init` on an empty project.
* Bug fix: File API was returning `102 Continue` error status when fetching a file begin currently imported. It was making subsequent requests fail. The File API now returns `503 Service Unavailable`. Client was updated to handle this status.
* Fix `wti status` command.
* Improvement: truncate `wti pull` performance statistics (`Pulled 10 files in 0.7 seconds at 13.4 files/sec`).
* Fix: Configuration file lookup improvements. Configuration files can now be located in another directory, and `wti` commands don’t have to be executed in the root directory. It is now possible to execute:
  
  ```
  wti pull 
  wti pull -c /Users/edouard/code/test/.wti
  wti pull -c ../.wti
  wti pull -c ~/code/.wti
  ```

## Version 1.9.1 / 2011-12-08

* Add `wti rm` and `wti rmlocale` to CLI help.
* Sort files by name in `wti push`.
* Improve command-line interface. Executing `wti` should now give help.
* Bug fix: TranslationFile timeouts, #77. (@bray).

## Version 1.9.0 / 2011-11-23

* Deprecate `wti server`. This feature was introducing a hard dependency on Sinatra, which is not desirable when embedding `web_translate_it` on a Rails application. `wti server` now lives in a separate gem, `web_translate_it_server`, which depends on the `web_translate_it` gem. To keep using `wti server`, execute: `gem install web_translate_it_server` and run: `wti-server`. 

## Version 1.8.4 / 2011-11-14

* Add new command `wti rmlocale locale_code_1 locale_code_2 ...` to delete a locale from a project.
* Add new command `wti rm path_to_file1 path_to_file2 ...` to delete a master file from a project.
* `wti` sends client name and version in custom headers. #73.

## Version 1.8.3 / 2011-11-14

* Bring back `-c` option to specify a configuration file with a specific name. `wti pull -c config/translations.yml` for instance. See #67 and #71.
* `web_translate_it` rubygem now respects [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). #72.

## Version 1.8.2.3 / 2011-11-09

* Remove `sanitize_locale`. This method was replacing locale codes like `en_US` by `en-US`.
  It is now up to the user to make sure they use the correct locale format.
* Fix minor display bug during wti pull. See #70.

## Version 1.8.2.2 / 2011-11-05

* Add `--low-priority` option to `wti add` command.

## Version 1.8.2.1 / 2011-10-14

* Fix frozen string bug on ruby 1.9.3 (thanks @mikian for the patch).
* Fix: arrays of symbols `ignore_locales: [:en, :fr]` are not being parsed by Psych.
  People should use an array of strings (`ignore_locales: ['en', 'fr']`) or the longer version instead:
  ``` yaml
  ignore_locales:
    - :en
    - :fr
  ```

## Version 1.8.2.0 / 2011-09-12

* `wti pull` downloads files in parallel, using up to 20 threads.
  This makes syncing much faster for projects containing many files (up to 65 files/sec). 
* Default configuration file was renamed `.wti`. #67.
  The upgrade process should be seamless. Config file will be renamed if a `config/translation.yml` file is detected.

## Version 1.8.1.9 / 2011-09-07

* Possible fix for encoding issue in .gemspec file, #66
* Removed dependency on `ansi` gem, so wti now installs smoothly on Windows machines.
  Prior to that Windows users had to manually install the `win32console` gem. #62.

## Version 1.8.1.8 / 2011-07-29

* Revert previous commit, which didn’t work. Added an extra step to the Windows installation
  instructions: http://help.webtranslateit.com/kb/tips/how-to-install-wti-on-windows
* Fix broken `WebTranslateIt.fetch_translations`, #63.

## Version 1.8.1.7 / 2011-07-29

* Add dependency on `win32console` for Microsoft Windows users.

## Version 1.8.1.6 / 2011-07-25

* Update multipart-post dependency.
* Only include CA cert of WTI’s SSL certificate issuer. #61.

## Version 1.8.1.5 / 2011-07-19

* Update ansi dependency.
* Bug fix: re-recreate http connection from scratch after SSL certificate verification failure.

## Version 1.8.1.4 / 2011-06-29

* Bug fix: don’t try to modify a frozen object during fall back to non-verified SSL. #60

## Version 1.8.1.3 / 2011-06-24

* `wti` now falls back to non-verified SSL connections if SSL verification cannot be done.

## Version 1.8.1.2 / 2011-06-20

* Bug fix: Disable colors when running under MS Windows. #58
* Bug fix: Don’t verify SSL certificate when running under MS Windows. #57

## Version 1.8.1.0 / 2011-06-08

* Upgrade `multipart-post` dependency.
* Replace `rainbow` dependency by `ansi`, which can also format columns. #55
* Bug fix: `translation.yml` file wasn’t created on new projects.
* New: Gracefully quit on interrupt.
* New command: `wti match`. Displays files matching with the File Manager.
* Improved help commands.

## Version 1.8.0.1 / 2011-06-01

* Fix: SSL certificate verification wasn’t working on some systems (at least Ubuntu).

## Version 1.8.0.0 / 2011-05-31

* New: Faster file transfers using KeepAlive’d connection.
* New: Verify SSL certificate on connection.
* Fix: Display more detailed error messages on unconfigured projects. Ticket #56
* Fix: `wti init` now checks if configuration file is writable. Ticket #35
* Remove rake tasks. Rake tasks are much slower than the `wti executable` and were removed.
  Should you want the rake tasks back, see how to add them in your project
  [on the wiki](https://github.com/AtelierConvivialite/webtranslateit/wiki/Rake-tasks).

## Version 1.7.3.1 / 2011-05-06

* Fix: Broken links on `wti server`.
* Fix: Avoid crashes on blank checksums. Ticket #53
  This bug could happen when the file checksum is not yet calculated by WTI server, typically by doing a wti push, then wti pull too quickly.
* Update Sinatra to 1.2.6.

## Version 1.7.3.0 / 2011-04-12

* New: Compare local file checksum with file checksum from WTI API to determine if file needs downloading.
  We were previously using the date of last modification which can be a little bit unreliable.
* Remove `wti autoconf` and `wti stats`.
  These commands were deprecated in favour of `wti init` and `wti status` (and its alias `wti st`).

  For instance: `wti push -l "en fr"`
* New: Coloured terminal output.
* New: `before_pull` and `after_pull` hooks now work for all kind of `wti pull` (not only within `wti server`).
* New: Added 2 new hooks: `before_push` and `after_push`.

## Version 1.7.1.7 / 2011-03-07

* New: `wti unknow_command` explains how to get help.
* Upgrade Sinatra to 1.2.0.

* Bug fix: Make rake task create locale directory if it doesn’t exist yet. (Romain Sempé)
* Bug fix: Make the list of ignore locales work for wti pull (it won’t pull the locales you ignore)

* **Breaking update**: The project configuration changed and doesn’t include a list of master language files any longer.
  This makes configuration much simpler. However you must configure the exact file path of your files in
  the File Manager. This allows much more flexibility for the choice of your language file names. Ref #22.

## Version 1.5.2 /2010-03-13

* Only added a man page.

## Version 1.5.1 /2010-03-09

## Version 1.5.0 /2010-02-19

Warning, some deprecations in this version.

* Remove `wti fetch` and `wti upload`. It was deprecated in 1.4.7 in favour of `wti pull` and `wti push` respectively.
* `wti push` now only pushes the master language file. Use `wti push --all` to push all or `wti push -l [locale]` to push a specific locale.

* Add --force parameter to force Web Translate It to send the language files again, regardless if the current 
  language file version is current (this makes `wti pull` very much slower).
* Add `wti autoconf` command to automatically configure your project for Web Translate It.

## Version 1.4.6 /2010-02-04

* Add feedback when using the `wti command`.
* Fix bug where fetch requests were not using the conditional get requests feature.

* The plugin is now a gem

## Version 1.3.0 / 2010-01-05

## Version 1.2.1 / 2010-01-04

* Add some documentation
* More feedback on file upload

## Version 1.2 / 2010-01-04
